# ALC4.0
ALC4 project files

This is my first time using GitHub as a contributor and, especially, as a project owner and I have the google-andela sponsored project
to thank for that.

Publishing this project on git came with a lot of trial and errors and that's why the commit message isn't as descriptive as it should be but, now that I understand a bit how things run here, subsequent commits should come in a breeze and, hopefully, with a better touch of professionalism.

This is the outcome of the first assignment given to the Android track candidates and here is my own submission. I hope to finish this course and earn the certification at the end and, ultimately, emerge a well-proven android app developer.

Thanks to all the team members supporting us.
